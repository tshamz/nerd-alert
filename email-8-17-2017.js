  <p ${styles.p}><strong>Welcome to Nerd Alert‚Ñ¢.</strong> Last issue we covered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout">CSS grids</a> and all things grid related. There was even a <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/262-css-grid-rachel-andrew-jen-simmons/">podcast</a> and a <a href="http://cssgridgarden.com/">game</a>!</p>
  <p ${styles.p}>In this issue we'll be looking at some of the new features in ES6, specifically promises and <code>fetch()</code>. If you love commitment, then you'll love promises. And if you love jQuery's <code>$.get()</code>, then you'll love <code>fetch()</code>. </p>
  <p ${styles.p}>I've also found a new (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUf2pmpMfO4">at least new for me, back off!</a>) Shopify resource that I'm very excited to share with everyone. If you love emails, and if you love Shopify apps, then you're gonna love this one! And even if you don't love emails, you're still gonna love this one!</p>
  <p ${styles.p}><em>Side note: I hadn't anticipated such demand for this email so you might find this edition especially nerdy. In the coming issues I'll make sure to include more accessable nerd content so that everyone can enjoy!</em></p>
  <h2 ${styles.h2}>üíç Promises</h2>
  <hr>
  <p ${styles.p}>Let's start with promises. To be honest, most of you are probably familiar with promises and just don't know it. Have you ever used <code>.done()</code>, or <code>.fail()</code> with a <code>$.get()</code>? Then you've used the jQuery flavor of promises! Promises are an alternative to callbacks when we're working with asynchronous code. They make your code very pretty and ES6 has support for them natively. Because many of the actions we do in JavaScript involve waiting for indiscriminate periods of time (e.g. API requests, elements in the DOM being ready, API requests, and did I mention <strong>API requests</strong>?), knowing how to use promises to handle the sequencing of these actions is extremely important. Read up, because I can guarantee promises are gonna be in your future.</p>

  </ul>
  <h2 ${styles.h2}>üêï <code>fetch()</code></h2>
  <hr>
  <p ${styles.p}>Do you hate including the entire jQuery library just so you can use <code>$.get</code>? Wish using <code>XMLHttpRequest()</code> didn't require an 15 additional lines of code? Do you find the lack of native promises in your AJAX requests to be troubling? Then you should try <code>fetch()</code>! New in ES6, <code>fetch()</code> does all of the things listed above (makes AJAX requests, returns promises, single line of code) all from the comfort of your browser! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08drNP-tZbI">Gretchen, cheer up!</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0">Fetch has finally happened!</a></p>

  <h2 ${styles.h2}>üõç Shop'fy Stash</h2>
  <hr>
  <p ${styles.p}>The strangest thing happened to me the other day. I was sitting at my desk thinking about the next edition of Nert Alert‚Ñ¢ and how I'd like to include more stuff on Shopify. Just then, an email popped into my inbox.</p>
  <p ${styles.p}>"Nice to meet you !" the subject line read. And while this subject line was nothing special, (clearly this person hadn't pre-enrolled up for my "Tyler Shambora Performance Emoji Marketing Seminar" (Fall 2017)), I have to admit, my interest was piqued.
  <p ${styles.p}>I opened the email and at first glance, it looked like any other 3rd party Shopify spam. However, after reaching the bottom of the message, I read, "Three apps, selected for you". Three apps? Selected just for me??? Yah rite. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1912617.main_image.gif?strip=all">You don't know me!</a></p>
  <p ${styles.p}>Long story short, they did know me. The apps were pretty cool and so was their site. It's basically a hub for Shopify resources categorized by function. I signed up for their weekly email and if you ignore the somewhat broken English and their weird spelling of "Shopify" as "Shop'fy", it's been a pretty good read. I'd suggest checking it out and signing up for the email.</p>
  <p ${styles.p}><em>Side note: if anyone knows how I got on their email list or was responsible for putting me on it, please make yourself known. I swear, I'm not mad! I just want to thank you!</em></p>

    <li><strong>Bonus!</strong> I also found this article from tuts+ that talks about <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/whats-new-for-shopify-theme-developers-in-2017--cms-29176">What‚Äôs New for Shopify Theme Developers in 2017</a>, so I thought I'd share that as well</li>
